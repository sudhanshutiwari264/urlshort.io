## How It Works

SudhanshuLinks uses browser local storage to save your shortened URLs. When someone visits a short link (in the format `https://username.github.io/repository/?s=shortcode`), the application checks if the shortcode exists in the database and redirects to the corresponding long URL.

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to the repository settings
3. Navigate to the "Pages" section
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Click "Save"
6. Your URL shortener will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Using a Custom Domain

1. After deploying to GitHub Pages, go to the repository settings
2. In the "Pages" section, enter your custom domain
3. Update your domain's DNS settings:
   - Add an A record pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses
   - Or add a CNAME record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`
4. Wait for DNS propagation (may take up to 48 hours)

## Usage

1. Enter the long URL you want to shorten
2. (Optional) Enter a custom path for your short URL
3. Click "Shorten"
4. Copy the generated short URL or QR code
5. Share your short link!

## Limitations

- Since this application uses browser local storage, your shortened URLs are stored in the browser you use to create them
- The application works best with a custom domain
- GitHub Pages has usage limits, so this is best for personal use rather than high-traffic applications
